Chaungtha:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chaungtha is a village and beach resort located in Ayeyarwady Region, Myanmar. Chaungtha Beach,
as it is more commonly known, is about 5 hours' drive away from Yangon, and is a popular resort with Yangonites from October to April. As
it is relatively more affordable than the nearby Ngwesaung and Ngapali beaches, Chaungtha is also more crowded and less cleanly than the
two more expensive and better maintained beaches.
</p>
<p>
Etymology:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chaungtha received its name from the small stream (chaung) which flowed at the western part of
the village. In the Burmese language, Chaungtha means Pleasant Stream.
</p>
<p>
Attraction:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chaungtha is renowned for its fresh and reasonably priced seafood. A major attraction is
a small pagoda built on a limestone boulder at the southern end of the beach. Nearby fishing villages and tidal mangrove forests are also 
popular among the tourists.
