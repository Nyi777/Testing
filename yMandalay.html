Mandalay:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mandalay is the second-largest city and the last royal capital of Myanmar (Burma). Located 716 km 
(445 mi) north of Yangon on the east bank of the Irrawaddy River, the city has a population of 1,225,553 (2014 census). Mandalay is the economic 
centre of Upper Burma and considered the centre of Burmese culture. A continuing influx of Chinese immigrants, mostly from Yunnan, in the past 
20 years, has reshaped the city's ethnic makeup and increased commerce with China. Despite Naypyidaw's recent rise, Mandalay remains 
Upper Burma's main commercial, educational and health center.

Climate:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rain shadow of the Arakan Mountains is so powerful that the city qualifies as having a hot 
semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification: BSh), although it does border on a tropical wet and dry climate (Köppen climate classification: 
Aw). Mandalay features noticeably warmer and cooler periods of the year. Average temperatures in January, the mildest month, hovers around 21 °C 
or 69.8 °F while the hottest month, April, averages 31 °C or 87.8 °F.<br>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mandalay is very hot in the months of April and May, with average high 
temperatures easily exceeding 35 °C or 95 °F. It is not uncommon to see high temperatures surpass 40 °C or 104 °F during these two months in 
the city. Mandalay also features wet and dry seasons of nearly equal length, with the wet season running from May through October and the dry 
season covering the remaining six months. The highest reliably recorded temperature in Mandalay is 48.0 °C (118.4 °F) on April 24, 1975 while 
the lowest is 7.6 °C (45.7 °F) on December 26, 1999.[29] There is considerably more diurnal temperature variation in the dry season than the
wet 
season.
