Putao:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Putao is the northernmost town of Kachin State, Myanmar. It is the principal town in Putao Township. 
It can only be reached by road during summer (for locals), but is accessible year round by air if there are sufficient tourist groups to justify 
a plane. The area around Putao is famous for the variety of endemic birds and rare orchids, which grow naturally. Many orchid lovers are 
especially attracted by the so-called "Black Orchid" that can be found in the mountains east and west of Putao. Hkakabo Razi and other 
snow-capped mountains are visible from Putao. Putao also attracts enthusiasts, hiking to Hkakabo Razi base camp, located close to Tahaundam.
