Kyaiktiyo Pagoda:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kyaiktiyo Pagoda also known as Golden Rock.It is a well-known Buddhist pilgrimage site in 
Mon State, Burma. It is a small pagoda (7.3 metres (24 ft)) built on the top of a granite boulder covered with gold leaves pasted on by its male 
devotees. According to legend, the Golden Rock itself is precariously perched on a strand of the Buddha's hair. The balancing rock seems to 
defy gravity, as it perpetually appears to be on the verge of rolling down the hill. The rock and the pagoda are at the top of Mt. Kyaiktiyo. 
Another legend states that a Buddhist priest impressed the celestial king with his asceticism and the celestial king used his supernatural 
powers to carry the rock to its current place, specifically choosing the rock as the resemblance to the monks head. It is the third most 
important Buddhist pilgrimage site in Burma after the Shwedagon Pagoda and the Mahamuni Pagoda. Currently, women are not allowed into the inner
sanctuary of the rocks vicinity, maintained by an employed security guard who watches over the gated entrance. Women are permitted in the outer 
balcony and the lower courtyard of the rock.

Structures:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boulder, which gleams golden and popularly known as the Golden Rock on which the small 
Kyaiktiyo Pagoda has been built, is about 25 feet (7.6 m) in height and has a circumference of 50 feet (15 m). The Pagoda above the rock is 
about 7.3 metres (24 ft) in height. The boulder sits on a natural rock platform that appears to have been naturally formed to act as the base 
to build the pagoda. This granite boulder lies on an inclined plane and the area of contact is extremely small. The golden rock or boulder and 
the rock table on which it is resting are independent of each other; the golden rock has an overhang of half its length and is perched at the 
extreme end of the sloping surface of the rock. There is a sheer vertical drop in the rock face, into the valley below.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A lotus shape is painted in gold leaf, encircling the base of the rock. It appears as though the 
boulder will crash down at any moment. A staircase leads to the pagoda complex that houses several viewing platforms, pagodas, Buddha shrines, 
and nats (spirits worshipped in Burma in conjunction with Buddhism shrines). However, the Golden Rock is the main attraction for the pilgrims
who offer prayers and also stick golden leaves on the rock in reverence. A short distance away, there is a circle of gongs with four statues 
of nats and angels in the centre. A main square close to the golden rock has many establishments that deal in religious paraphernalia for
worship and offerings made by the pilgrims. Adjoining the plaza area is the Potemkin village where restaurants, gift shops, and guest houses 
are located. A new terrace has been built at a lower level from which visitors can get a good view of the rock and the pagoda.
