Mawlamyine:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mawlamyine formerly Moulmein, is the fourth largest city of Myanmar (Burma), 300 km south east 
of Yangon and 70 km south of Thaton, at the mouth of Thanlwin (Salween) River. The city is the capital and largest city of Mon State and the 
main trading center and seaport in south eastern Myanmar</p>
<p>
Etymology and legend:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mon name which was previously used for Mawlamyine, Moulmein means "damaged eye" or "one-eyed man."
According to legend, a Mon king had a powerful third eye in the centre of his forehead, able to see what was happening in neighbouring 
kingdoms. The daughter of one of the neighbouring kings was given in marriage to the three-eyed king and managed to destroy the third eye.
The Burmese name "Mawlamyine" is believed to be a corruption of the Mon name. Moulmein was also spelled as Maulmain in some records of the 19th century.
