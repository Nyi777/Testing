Pindaya:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pindaya Caves located next to the town of Pindaya, Shan State, Burma (Myanmar) are a Buddhist
pilgrimage site and a tourist attraction located on a limestone ridge in the Myelat region. The area is part of the ancestral homeland of the
Danu people. There are three caves on the ridge which runs north-south, but only the southern cave can be entered and explored. It is not 
known whether the other two penetrate for any extended distance into the hillside. Scholars have been pushing for the site's inclusion in 
the UNESCO World Heritage List.

Access:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a 15-m (49 ft) pagoda named Shwe U Min (Golden Cave) Pagoda at the entrance to the 
southernmost cave. Local legend attributes this pagoda as being built by King Asoka and repaired by King Alaungsithu in the 12th century,
but this is not corroborated by any other historical source. In its present form and style, it is immediately apparent that the pagoda is
of recent origin. There is a large bronze bell at the southern entrance. The barely readable inscription on the bell states it as being cast 
in 1842 with a weight of 400 viss (654 kg). The modern day entrance dates from 1925 when the entrance to the cave was enlarged by explosives, 
destroying some valuable images and epigraphs in the process. A steel structure was erected to accommodate the many pilgrims. Dedication 
inscriptions from this renovation indicate a wide range of donors, not only from the Theravada community, but also from the Hindu, Chinese 
and even Muslim communities. During this renovation, some unique images were removed to a nearby monastery. Unfortunately, these images were 
destroyed during World War II in a bombing raid. An elevator was added in more recent times.
