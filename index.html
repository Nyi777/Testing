          This captivating country is richly endowed with spectacular scenery, colorful cultures and awe-inspiring historic sites, with something 
          new to discover around every bend. While it’s true that Myanmar only recently relaxed its travel restrictions, this should be no 
          deterrent. As local experts, we can assure you there’s plenty of travel infrastructure and as many chances to experience luxury as 
          there are to immerse yourself in the country’s rustic charms, or to delve into its spirituality. Drawing on decades of experience in
          the region, we can think of multiple reasons why you should book a trip to Myanmar without delay. Here, we give you reasons why you
          should see Myanmar as soon as you can…

            Natural beauty:
Myanmar really is one incredibly good-looking country. Paradise beaches with perfect water and white sand, misty mountains, tangled jungles, 
majestic Inle Lake, the wide Irrawaddy River, the rugged highlands, the lush lowlands – Myanmar’s stunning landscapes are truly breathtaking.
Combine these stunning backdrops with some of the world’s most well-preserved historic sites and you’ve got pure travel magic.

            The ‘undiscovered’ vibe: 
A tourist hub Myanmar is not. While the capital, Yangon, has its fair share of expats, Western brands and five-star hotels, you don’t have to 
venture far to feel as if you’ve departed the beaten path. In Yangon, you can hop aboard the circular railway for an authentic view of local 
life, and all across the country, even the most visited places have minimal crowds if you travel in low season. When it comes to lesser-known 
areas, such as the Mergui Archipelago or Putao in the Himalayan foothills, you’ll truly feel like an explorer no matter when you travel.

            Balloons over Bagan:
A bit about Bagan: It is one of Myanmar’s most visited sites. It is incredibly scenic. It comprises more than 2,000 ancient stupas. It dates 
back to the 9th-century Pagan Kingdom. It is possible to float over these spires in a hot air balloon. Bagan is a must-see. Ballooning is the 
more unconventional way of taking it all in and one that may not be possible for much longer depending on local laws. If ballooning over Bagan
is on your bucket list, we recommend not waiting too long.

            The majestic Mrauk U: 
From 1430 to 1785 Mrauk U was the center of the Arakanese Kingdom. A powerful merchant city situated on the Bay of Bengal, remnants of this 
lost civilization still stand, dotted around the town and the surrounding countryside.

            Mouth-watering flavors:
Myanmar is a melting pot of cultures, which is another way of saying it’s a crock pot of flavors. You’ve got tea, courtesy of the British; 
curry, thanks to Yangon’s Indian population; Chinese food; Shan noodles; traditional Burmese cuisine; fish dishes and even locally produced 
wine. The spectrum of Myanmar’s culinary delights ranges from street food to fine dining, within which are certain dishes you must not miss.
If you only eat two local dishes in Myanmar, make them mohinga, a breakfast noodle dish with fish broth and crispy fried fritter things on top,
and laphet thoke an iconic salad of fermented tea leaves. (Both taste much better better than they sound).

            A really tall railway track:
Don’t look down – the Gokteik Viaduct soars 100 meters above a deep ravine, taking a literally breathtaking route over waterfalls and lush 
tangled forest. Constructed in the year 1900, it’s a nostalgic way to traverse the highlands to the pretty colonial outpost of Pyin Oo Lwin, 
serving up unbeatable mountain views along the way.

            Literary footsteps:
Bagan – or Pagan, as it was then called – was so beautiful, Marco Polo wrote about it. George Orwell used the town of Katha as the setting for 
his first novel, Burmese Days. Then there’s the famous Road to Mandalay, penned by Rudyard Kipling, who never actually set foot in the city. 
Myanmar is a place where you can retrace the steps of some heavyweight authors, where you can view its landscapes and cultures through
different eyes.To balance the colonial perspective, contemporary authors, such as novelist Wendy Law-Yone and non-fiction writer Thant Myint-U 
will provide a more modern point of view.

            Pagodas of all types:
Thailand’s got the Grand Palace, Cambodia has Angkor Wat, and Myanmar has a startling array of stupas, temples and pagodas. There’s the 
aforementioned 2,000 temples of Bagan. Then there’s the soaring, glittering 2,500-year-old Shwedagon pagoda in Yangon. There’s a temple atop 
the volcanic Mount Popa, which you can reach after climbing 777 steps. And a pagoda called Kyaiktiyo on top of a golden rock. And don’t forget 
Kyauk Kalap pagoda out in Hpa An which is perched on top of a rock formation. If you like religious sites, Myanmar’s got you covered.

            A luxury river cruise:
A plush private cabin, a wide sundeck, a drink in your hand and the tranquil landscapes of the Irrawaddy passing by – can you think of a more 
luxuriously laidback journey? Aside from the obvious advantages of comfort and convenience that a river cruise brings, it also lets you see 
Myanmar from a different angle. Stop off in Bagan and Mandalay, float past sleepy riverside villages, enjoy fine dining onboard and toast to 
the stars from the deck. There’s a timelessness about river travel – especially on a colonial-style steamboat – and the mighty Irrawaddy River 
only enhances that old-world mood.

            BIG Buddha statues:
Myanmar is home to the second-largest reclining Buddha statue in the world as well as the second-largest standing Buddha statue.
Both of these towering golden figures can be found at a place called Maha Bodhi Ta Htaung, a religious site just outside Monywa.
The 90-meter-long reclining Buddha is hollow, and you can walk inside it to see more Buddha images.

            Lake life:
Two words: Inle Lake. This 116-square-kilometer lake is not only visually captivating, it’s home to some truly unique sights. For example,
nowhere will you find fishermen who row with one leg wrapped around the oar while balancing on the bow of their narrow boat. Then there are 
the townships hovering on stilts over the shallow waters, and the families who families ply between them on wooden canoes.

            Taunggyi fire balloons:
Combine the end of rainy season with hot air balloons and you’ve got yourself the Tazaungdaing Festival in Taunggyi. The festival is held 
around the full moon in November, and is the equivalent of Thailand’s Loy Krathong festival. The main difference is that instead of releasing 
lanterns, people release gigantic homemade balloons fitted with fireworks that literally explode over the crowd.

          A village for cats:
Did you know that, by the 1930s, Burmese cat breed had completely died out in Myanmar? In fact, if not for the breeding center at Inle
Heritage, Myanmar would have lost this important part of its culture. In 2009, the cats were reintroduced and now more than 40 purebred 
pedigree Burmese have their own tiny island where you can go meet them and play with them. Inle Heritage is a non-profit that incorporates 
a traditional Inthar stilt house with a gallery of local art, a guesthouse and a restaurant that provides vocational hospitality training to 
local youths. It’s the purrfect day trip, even if you’re not the most enthusiastic cat person.

          Mountain tribe treks:
If you’ve got an adventurous spirit, Nat Ma Taung AKA Mount Victoria gives you reasonably easy hiking terrain through national parkland – green 
undulating landscapes and pure mountain air. Drive to Kanpetlet from Bagan – perhaps in an open-top jeep, wind in your hair – and trek to Aye
 to meet locals who still practice traditional facial tattooing. If you’re inclined, organize a homestay and enjoy a home-cooked dinner.

          A deserted tropical paradise:
Imagine sailing through an idyllic archipelago, stopping off at deserted islands, each one more beautiful than the last, diving into crystal
blue waters, strolling perfect white beaches, hiking virgin jungles. Too good to be true? Not for now, at least – the recently opened Mergui
Archipelago on Myanmar’s Andaman Sea coastline gives you all of the above. A sailing trip is the best way to see this breathtaking region –
some parts are still officially uncharted, so stick with a crew who knows the area.

            An 18-day festival:
Phaung Daw U pagoda floats above Inle Lake like a shimmering mirage, and for 18 days a year it’s the center of one of Myanmar’s most unique 
festivals. During the Burmese month of Thadingyut the pagoda’s five sacred Buddha images are taken around the lake on a royal barge-style boat 
so pilgrims can pay their respects to them. It’s a colorful, upbeat affair where you can witness some expert foot paddling from local oarsmen.

            Contemporary Art:
Yangon is more than temples and teahouses – it’s a hotbed of artistic talent. If you like to explore contemporary culture, one of your first 
stops should be the TS1 Yangon Pop-Up Project, which gives you plenty to mull over, with waterfront warehouses transformed into galleries.        
Elsewhere in the city you’ll find everything from upmarket studios to NGO-affiliated galleries to local artisan boutiques selling handicrafts 
– an insider art tour is the best way to uncover these gems.

            A beach getaway:
Beach lovers will find plenty of reasons to visit Myanmar. You don’t need to go sailing in a remote archipelago to find a paradise beach – the
 Bay of Bengal offers up idyllic Andaman coastline with all the white sands and clear blue waters you could hope for. The most celebrated of 
 all Myanmar beaches is Ngapali, where you’ll find luxurious resorts, amazing seafood, quality snorkeling and a welcoming, laidback coastal 
 vibe.

      A splashy New Year
Fancy a country-wide water fight? New Year in Myanmar includes the Thingyan Water Festival. The entire New Year period is from April 13-19 
and constitutes big water fights followed by a few days of peaceful reflection and merit making. If you want to see Yangon at its most festive,
 plan your Myanmar trip to coincide with this wet and wonderful celebration.
