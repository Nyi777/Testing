Mrauk U:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrauk U is an archaeologically important town in northern Rakhine State, Myanmar. It is also the 
capital of Mrauk-U Township, a sub region of the Mrauk-U District. From 1430 until 1785, it was the capital of the Mrauk U Kingdom, the most 
important and powerful Rakhine (Arakanese) kingdom.

<p>
Climate:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrauk U, like much of Rakhine State, is situated in a coastal tropical monsoon rainforest climate
region. The town receives over 1,200 millimetres (47 in) of rain a year from the Southwestern Monsoon, making it one of the wettest regions in
Myanmar. The Monsoon season usually begins in late May and ends by mid October. Although located in a tropical region, Mrauk U enjoys lower 
temperatures when the Northeastern Monsoon falls. From mid October to mid March during the Cool Season, temperatures can drop to 13 °C (55 °F).
This season coincides with the tourist season for Myanmar. The rainfall on 19 July 2011 was nearly 24 centimetres (9.4 in), the highest for 33
years. There was flood because of continuous heavy rains in July 2011.
