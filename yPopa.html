Mount Popa:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mount Popa is an extinct volcano 1518 metres (4981 feet) above sea level, and located in central Myanmar 
(formerly Burma) in the region of Mandalay about 50 km (31 mi) southeast of Bagan (Pagan) in the Pegu Range. It can be seen from the Ayeyarwady
(Irrawaddy) River as far away as 60 km (37 mi) in clear weather. Mount Popa is perhaps best known as a pilgrimage site, with numerous Nat 
temples and relic sites atop the mountain.

<p>
EtymologyBagan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the present-day standard Burmese pronunciation of the Burmese word Pugan (ပုဂံ), derived from Old Burmese Pukam. Its classical 
Pali name is Arimaddanapura. Its other names in Pali are in reference to its extreme 
dry zone climate: Tattadesa, and Tampadīpa.The Burmese chronicles also report 
other classical names of Thiri Pyissaya and Tampawaddy.

Popular destination:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Me Wunna with her sons Min Gyi and Min Lay at Mt Popa Many Burmese pilgrims visit Mt 
Popa every year, especially at festival season on the full moon of Nayon (May/June) and the full moon of Nadaw (November/December). Local people
from the foot of Mt Popa, at Kyaukpadaung (10-miles), go mass-hiking to the peak during December and also in April when the Myanmar new year 
called Thingyan festival is celebrated. Before King Anawrahta's time, hundreds of animals were sacrificed to the nats during festivals.
Burmese superstition says that on Mt Popa, one should not wear red or black or green or bring meat, especially pork, as it could offend the 
resident nats, although Byatta and his brother Byatwi were the only Muslims who had shipwrecked and landed in Burma.
