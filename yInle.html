Inle Lake:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inle lake a freshwater lake located in the Nyaungshwe Township of Taunggyi District of Shan State,
part of Shan Hills in Myanmar (Burma). It is the second largest lake in Myanmar with an estimated surface area of 44.9 square miles (116 km2), 
and one of the highest at an elevation of 2,900 feet (880 m). During the dry season, the average water depth is 7 feet (2.1 m), with the deepest
point being 12 feet (3.7 m), but during the rainy season this can increase by 5 feet (1.5 m).The watershed area for the lake lies to a large 
extent to the north and west of the lake. The lake drains through the Nam Pilu or Balu Chaung on its southern end. There is also a hot spring 
on its northwestern shore.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the lake is not large, it contains a number of endemic species. Over twenty species of snails
and nine species of fish are found nowhere else in the world. Some of these, like the silver-blue scaleless Sawbwa barb, the crossbanded dwarf
danio, and the Lake Inle danio, are of minor commercial importance for the aquarium trade. It hosts approximately 20,000 brown and black head
migratory seagulls in November, December and January. In June 2015, it became Myanmar's first designated place of World Network of Biosphere 
Reserves. It was one of 20 places added at the Unesco's 27th Man and the Biosphere (MAB) International Coordinating Council (ICC) meeting.
Since 2018 it has been designated as a protected Ramsar site.

People and culture:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inle Lake with its leg-rowing Intha people is a major tourist destination in Burma.
Fisherman at InleA floating tomato garden on Inle Lake Positioning eel traps in Inle Lake. The people of Inle Lake (called Intha), some 70,000 
of them, live in four cities bordering the lake, in numerous small villages along the lake's shores, and on the lake itself. The entire lake 
area is in Nyaung Shwe township. The population consists predominantly of Intha, with a mix of other Shan, Taungyo, Pa-O (Taungthu), Danu, 
Kayah, Danaw and Bamar ethnicities. Most are devout Buddhists, and live in simple houses of wood and woven bamboo on stilts; they are largely 
self-sufficient farmers. Transportation on the lake is traditionally by small boats, or by somewhat larger boats fitted with single cylinder
inboard diesel engines.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Local fishermen are known for practicing a distinctive rowing style which involves standing at the stern on one leg and 
wrapping the other leg around the oar. This unique style evolved out of necessity as the lake is covered by reeds and floating plants, making 
it difficult to see above them while sitting. Standing provides the rower with a view beyond the reeds. However, the leg rowing style is only 
practiced by the men. Women row in the customary style, using the oar with their hands, sitting cross legged at the stern. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lotus thread is used 
to weave a special robe for the Buddha. On the way home from harvesting weeds in the lake Htamin jin (fermented rice) served with hnapyan jaw 
(twice-fried Shan tofu) is a popular local dish. Fish caught from the lake - the most abundant kind is called nga hpein locally (Inle carp, Cyprinus intha) - are a staple of the local diet. A popular local dish is htamin gyin - 'fermented' rice kneaded with fish and/or potato - served with hnapyan gyaw (literally twice fried - Shan tofu). In addition to fishing, locals grow vegetables and fruit in large gardens that float on the surface of the lake. The floating garden beds are formed by extensive manual labor. The farmers gather up lake-bottom weeds from the deeper parts of the lake, bring them back in boats and make them into floating beds in their garden areas, anchored by bamboo poles. These gardens rise and fall with changes in the water level, and so are resistant to flooding. The constant availability of nutrient-laden water results in these gardens being incredibly fertile. Rice cultivation and consumption is also significant facet of the local diet and agricultural tradition. </p>
