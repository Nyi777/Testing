  Yangon:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;formerly known as Rangoon, is the capital of the Yangon Region and commercial capital of Myanmar (also known as Burma). Yangon served as the administrative capital of Myanmar until 2006, when the military government relocated the administrative functions to the purpose-built city of Naypyidaw in central Myanmar. With over 7 million people, Yangon is Myanmar's largest city and its most important commercial centre.
  Yangon boasts the largest number of colonial-era buildings in Southeast Asia, and has a unique colonial-era urban core that is remarkably intact. The colonial-era commercial core is centred around the Sule Pagoda, which is reputed to be over 2,000 years old. The city is also home to the gilded Shwedagon Pagoda – Myanmar's most sacred Buddhist pagoda. The mausoleum of the last Mughal Emperor is located in Yangon, where he had been exiled following the Indian Mutiny of 1857.
  Yangon suffers from deeply inadequate infrastructure, especially compared to other major cities in Southeast Asia. Though many historic residential and commercial buildings have been renovated throughout central Yangon, most satellite towns that ring the city continue to be profoundly impoverished and lack basic infrastructure.

  Downtown Yangon selling produce. Yangon is the country's main centre for trade, industry, real estate, media, entertainment and tourism. The
  city represents about one fifth of the national economy. According to official statistics for FY 2010–2011, the size of the economy of Yangon
  Region was 8.93 trillion kyats, or 23% of the national GDP. Traffic congestion in Yangon Teashop on Pavement The city is Lower Burma's main 
  trading hub for all kinds of merchandise – from basic food stuffs to used cars although commerce continues to be hampered by the city's severely
  underdeveloped banking industry and communication infrastructure. Bayinnaung Market is the largest wholesale centre in the country for rice, 
  beans and pulses, and other agricultural commodities. Much of the country's legal imports and exports go through Thilawa Port, the largest 
  and busiest port in Burma. There is also a great deal of informal trade, especially in street markets that exist alongside street platforms
  of Downtown Yangon's townships. However, on 17 June 2011, the YCDC announced that street vendors, who had previously been allowed to legally 
  open shop at 3 pm, would be prohibited from selling on the streets, and permitted to sell only in their townships of residence, presumably to 
  clean up the city's image. Since 1 December 2009, high-density polyethylene plastic bags have been banned by city authorities.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Manufacturing accounts for a sizeable share of employment. At least 14 light industrial zones ring Yangon, directly employing over
   150,000 workers in 4,300 factories in early 2010. The city is the centre of country's garment industry which exported US$292 million in 
   2008/9 fiscal year. More than 80 percent of factory workers in Yangon work on a day-to-day basis. Most are young women between 15 and 27 
   years of age who come from the countryside in search of a better life. The manufacturing sector suffers from both structural problems 
   (e.g. chronic power shortages) and political problems (e.g. economic sanctions). In 2008, Yangon's 2500 factories alone needed about 120 MW 
   of power; yet, the entire city received only about 250 MW of the 530 MW needed.[80] Chronic power shortages limit the factories' operating
   hours between 8 am and 6 pm. Construction is a major source of employment. The construction industry has been negatively affected by the move 
   of state apparatus and civil servants to Naypyidaw, new regulations introduced in August 2009 requiring builders to provide at least 12 
   parking spaces in every new high-rise building, and the general poor business climate.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As of January 2010, the number of new high-rise building 
   starts approved in 2009–2010 was only 334, compared to 582 in 2008–2009. Tourism represents a major source of foreign currency for the city 
   although by south-east Asian standards the number of foreign visitors to Yangon has always been quite low—about 250,000 before the Saffron 
   Revolution in September 2007. The number of visitors dipped even further following the Saffron Revolution and Cyclone Nargis.[84] The recent 
   provement in the country's political climate has attracted an increasing number of businessmen and tourists. Between 300,000 and 400,000 
   visitors that went through Yangon International in 2011. However, after years of underinvestment, Yangon's modest hotel infrastructure—only 
   3000 of the total 8000 hotel rooms in Yangon are "suitable for tourists"—is already bursting at seams, and will need to be expanded to handle 
   additional visitors.[85] As part of an urban development strategy, a hotel zone has been planned in Yangon's outskirts, encompassing government-
    and military-owned land in Mingaladon, Hlegu and Htaukkyant Townships.
