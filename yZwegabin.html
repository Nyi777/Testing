Climbing Mount Zwegabin:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We contemplated for hours, whether or not we should take on the strenuous challenge
of ascending Mount Zwegabin. Finally, we came to an agreement – up it was! Luckily we did! And what we can say is that the view at dawn was
totally worth all the effort to get there. And yes, that’s right, DAWN. Most people start their hike to the summit after sunrise, but we 
really wanted to watch the sunrise from up above. It’s no easy thing to do for two non-morning people like us. At 4am, the alarm goes off. 
By 4:40am we were on our way up.
