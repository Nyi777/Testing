Bagan:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bagan is an ancient city and a UNESCO World Heritage Site located in the Mandalay Region of Myanmar. 
From the 9th to 13th centuries, the city was the capital of the Pagan Kingdom, the first kingdom that unified the regions
that would later constitute modern Myanmar. During the kingdom's height between the 11th and 13th centuries, over 10,000 Buddhist temples,
pagodas and monasteries were constructed in the Bagan plains alone, of which the remains of over 2,200 temples and pagodas still survive to 
the present day. The Bagan Archaeological Zone is a main attraction for the country's nascent tourism industry.

<p>
EtymologyBagan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the present-day standard Burmese pronunciation of the Burmese word Pugan (ပုဂံ), derived from Old Burmese Pukam. Its classical 
Pali name is Arimaddanapura. Its other names in Pali are in reference to its extreme 
dry zone climate: Tattadesa, and Tampadīpa.The Burmese chronicles also report 
other classical names of Thiri Pyissaya and Tampawaddy.

<p>
Climate:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bagan lies in the middle of the "dry zone" of Burma, the region roughly between Shwebo in the north and Pyay in the south. Unlike the coastal regions of the country, which receive annual monsoon rainfalls exceeding 2500 mm, the dry zone gets little precipitation as it is sheltered from the rain by the Rakhine Yoma mountain range in the west.
